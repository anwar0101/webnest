I was thinking of starting with setting up XAMPP and talking about what php is and what it is for.
Then some sink or swim basic "Hello world" type projects so as to talk about:

    1. Variables
    2. Number Types
    3. String Types
    4. Get and Post
    5. loops and arrays
    6. MySQLi connections and usage
